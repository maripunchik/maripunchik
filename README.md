# Hi 👋 I'm Maryna Melnyk  
### Markup Developer

I am a markup developer focused on building clean, scalable, well‑structured interfaces.  
My work is guided by clarity, consistency, and thoughtful UI architecture.

I translate designs into responsive, accessible layouts and pay close attention to detail —  
from semantic HTML to maintainable styling systems.  
I enjoy creating predictable, well‑organized interfaces that behave consistently across devices.

My workflow is based on modern front‑end practices and a structured approach to project organization.
